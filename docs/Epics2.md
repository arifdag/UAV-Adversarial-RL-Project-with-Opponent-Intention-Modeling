Below is an Agile-style backlog that turns the high-level roadmap into actionable Epics, Stories & Tasks for a single-developer project that uses gym-pybullet-drones as the simulator. Each Epic ends with a “Definition of Done” so you can tell when to close it.
________________________________________
EPIC 1 — Local Dev & Simulator Bootstrap
Goal: a repeatable environment where a demo drone can fly and log data.
Story	Tasks	DoD
E1-S1 Set up Python/conda workspace	1. conda create -n drones python=3.10 2. git clone https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones.git 3. pip install -e . (installs simulator plus deps) (github.com)
Conda env activates; python -c "import gym_pybullet_drones" runs w/o error
E1-S2 Smoke-test PID examples	1. cd gym_pybullet_drones/examples 2. python pid.py then python downwash.py 3. Watch GUI to confirm drone lifts & lands	Both scripts complete; log file saved
E1-S3 Smoke-test SB3 PPO example	1. python learn.py --multiagent false (single drone hover) 2. open TensorBoard → see reward curve rising (github.com)
10 k training steps run; TensorBoard shows ≥ 0 reward
E1-S4 Project skeleton repo	1. Initialise a new Git repo in sibling folder uav-combat-rl 2. Copy .pre-commit and template .gitignore 3. Enable GitHub Actions CI to run unit tests	CI badge green on main
________________________________________
EPIC 2 — Combat Scenario & Reward Design
Goal: custom environment that lets two drones “tag” each other.
Story	Tasks	DoD
E2-S1 Design combat MDP	1. Decide observation vector (own_state, opp_state, relative pos/vel, ammo) 2. Decide continuous actions (pitch, roll, yaw, thrust) or discrete “macro-maneuvers”	Spec doc committed
E2-S2 Extend Env class	1. Sub-class BaseAviary → CombatAviary 2. Add hit-detection (Sphere overlap or ray-cast) 3. Implement compute_reward() ( +1 hit, -1 taken, small -0.01/step )	pytest tests/test_env.py passes
E2-S3 Hard-code termination & bounds	1. End episode on hit or 30 s 2. Teleport drones back to origin each reset	Episode ends correctly in manual run
E2-S4 Script baselines	1. AggressorPolicy (full-throttle chase) 2. EvaderPolicy (orbital evasive)	Scripts run; visualization shows distinct behaviours
________________________________________
EPIC 3 — Measurement & Visualisation Harness
Goal: tooling to see win-rate, trajectories, and video replays.
Story	Tasks	DoD
E3-S1 Metric logger	1. Wrap CombatAviary in Gym Monitor 2. Log win, steps, damage per episode to CSV/W&B	CSV autopopulates
E3-S2 Trajectory plot util	1. Write helper to dump positions → .npz 2. Matplotlib script to plot 2D top-down path	Example plot saved plots/trajectory_baseline.png
E3-S3 Video recorder	1. Use PyBullet getCameraImage each step 2. Assemble with ffmpeg into .mp4	30 fps demo video plays
________________________________________
EPIC 4 — Baseline RL Agent vs Scripted Opponent (SB3)
Goal: prove an RL agent can learn to win against a fixed foe.
Story	Tasks	DoD
E4-S1 VecEnv wrapper	1. Create make_vec_env(n_envs=8) for parallel collect	8 envs run concurrently
E4-S2 Train PPO-MLP	1. stable_baselines3.PPO("MlpPolicy", …) 2. Hyper-params grid (lr, gamma) 3. 2 M steps	Mean win-rate ≥ 60 % vs Aggressor
E4-S3 Save & evaluate	1. Save checkpoint every 500 k steps 2. evaluate_policy() over 100 eps and log stats	Markdown report reports/baseline.md committed
________________________________________
EPIC 5 — Self-Play without Opponent Modeling
Goal: two learning agents co-evolve a combat policy.
Story	Tasks	DoD
E5-S1 Port env to RLlib MultiAgent	Use RLlib example workflow provided by gym-pybullet-drones docs (multiagent.py) (github.com)
rllib train … launches
E5-S2 League training loop	1. Store past checkpoints to league/ 2. 25 % of episodes sample older opponent	Training stable (no NaNs)
E5-S3 Benchmark vs SB3 baseline	Run round-robin evaluation of best RLlib policy vs SB3 baseline	Table of win-rates in /reports/league_vs_baseline.csv
________________________________________
EPIC 6 — Opponent Intention Modeling Integration
Goal: augment policy with auxiliary head that predicts opponent moves.
Story	Tasks	DoD
E6-S1 Network refactor	1. Fork SB3 ActorCriticPolicy → add aux head (softmax over opponent action space) 2. Return both value & opponent logits	Unit test passes forward pass
E6-S2 Custom loss	1. Implement cross-entropy term L_opp 2. Total loss L = L_rl + λ L_opp (start λ = 0.1)	Loss curves logged separately
E6-S3 Dataset warm-up	1. Roll out 20 k steps with frozen baseline opponent 2. Train only aux head for 3 epochs (supervised)	Aux accuracy ≥ 30 % on val split
E6-S4 Joint training	Resume PPO training with aux head active	After 2 M steps: • Opp-pred accuracy ≥ 60 % • Win-rate improves ≥ 10 pp over Epic 5
E6-S5 Ablation	Retrain same config with λ = 0 (no intention modeling)	Ablation curve plotted
________________________________________
EPIC 7 — Evaluation & Robustness
Goal: evidence the new agent generalises.
Story	Tasks	DoD
E7-S1 Scenario sweep	Test vs unseen scripted styles (spiral, dive-bomb)	Spreadsheet of win-rates
E7-S2 Noise & wind	Add random wind gusts to env; evaluate	Report shows <5 % drop in win-rate
E7-S3 Stat sig test	Paired t-test (baseline vs intention) over 1 000 episodes	p < 0.05
________________________________________
EPIC 8 — Visual Demo & Code Release
Goal: polish and share results.
Story	Tasks	DoD
E8-S1 Highlight video	Record 3 biggest wins; edit 60 s montage	MP4 <20 MB in media/
E8-S2 Repo cleanup	1. README.md quick-start 2. MIT license 3. DVC storage for checkpoints	Public GitHub repo passes poetry run pytest
E8-S3 Reproducibility script	One-click script run_all.sh to reproduce training + eval	Fresh clone reproduces Table 1

This backlog should carry you from zero to a functioning adversarial UAV RL system with opponent intention modeling, using only gym-pybullet-drones and mainstream Python tooling. Tackle Epics sequentially; treat each DoD as a gate before moving forward. Good luck, and feel free to iterate on task granularity to match your sprint cadence.
